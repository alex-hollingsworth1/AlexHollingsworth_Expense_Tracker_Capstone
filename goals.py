"""
Financial goal setting and tracking functionality.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS - Expense & Budget Tracker:
âœ… Completed:
- Add new expense/income categories to database
- Track spending and income
- View expense/income categories
- View expenses/income by category
- Set budget for a category
- View budget for a category
- Set financial goals
- View progress towards financial goals (via prompting)
- SQLite database connection and tables
- Menu system (1-11 options)

ðŸ”§ To verify/consider:
- Update an expense amount (may need separate function)
- Delete expense/income categories (have add, may need delete)
- Calculate user's budget based on income and expenses

NOTE: For saved_amount in goals - requirements don't explicitly need
database storage. Current prompting approach meets "View progress"
requirement. Could enhance with database storage to show UPDATE skills
if time permits.
